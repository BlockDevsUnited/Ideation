# Ideation

## Description
This repository will have any ideas/projects that you would want to work on, in the blockchain space. Being a blockchain agnostic club, feel free to propose projects on any blockchain platform. It could range from DApp on Ethereum, to a private blockchain on Hyperledger Fabric. Start hacking!

## How to propose?
The process is pretty simple. Just make a pull request to this repository with a small description of your proposal(in a new file) using markdown syntax (.md). Keep the filename as **project-name.md** .If you can clearly layout the plan in bullet points, that will be great but we can help build on that.
